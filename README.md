The user, initially, has 25 greatballs (with 60% of chances) and 5 ultraballs (with 90%), and infinite normal pokeballs (with 30% of chance). The amount of balls that the user has is stored on localStorage. On each normal pokeball throw, the user has 5% of chance to earn 20 greatballs and 5 ultraballs.
