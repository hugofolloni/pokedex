A pokemon game, that the user can search for pokemons, choose balls trying to catch them and, if he sucessfully did it, store them into a pokedex with all infos about that cute friend.

## 🧔 User Story
On the first page, the user click to start the game. The catch page is a random pokemon finder. The user can choose which ball he want to use to catch the pokemon that appeared, with different chances to get it based on the ball, or decide to not catch that pokemon and look for another. The user, initially, has 25 greatballs (with 60% of chances) and 5 ultraballs (with 90%), and infinite normal pokeballs (with 30% of chance). The amount of balls that the user has is stored on localStorage. On each normal pokeball throw, the user has 5% of chance to earn 20 greatballs and 5 ultraballs.
